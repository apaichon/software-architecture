# Title: High-Volume Ticketing System for K-Pop World Tour Concert
## Background:
A famous K-Pop band is conducting a world tour, with two concert rounds in Thailand. Each round can accommodate 50,000 attendees. The demand is expected to be extremely high, with over 100,000 fans from all over Asia attempting to secure tickets simultaneously.

## Key Points:

1. Concert Capacity: 50,000 per round, 100,000 total
2. Number of Rounds: 2
3. Expected Concurrent Users: 100,000+
4. User Base: Fans from all over Asia
5. High Demand-to-Supply Ratio: At least 100,000 people competing for 50,000 tickets per round

## Use Case Description:
Design a scalable and fair ticketing system that can handle an extremely high volume of concurrent users competing for a limited number of tickets

## Requirements:

1. High Concurrency: Handle 100,000+ simultaneous users.
2. Scalability: Ability to scale up quickly to meet sudden demand spikes.
3. Fairness: Implement a queuing system to give all fans a fair chance at tickets.
4. Performance: Maintain low latency despite high load.
5. Inventory Management: Accurately track and update ticket availability in real-time.
6. Fraud Prevention: Implement measures to prevent ticket scalping and bot purchases.
7. User Experience: Provide clear feedback on queue position and ticket availability.
8. Localization: Support multiple languages for fans across Asia.
9. Payment Processing: Handle a high volume of transactions in a short time frame.
10. Waitlist Management: Implement a waitlist system for sold-out events.

## Challenges to Address:

1. Traffic Surge: Manage the initial surge of 100,000+ users trying to access the system simultaneously.
2. Database Contention: Handle high read/write loads on the ticket inventory.
3. Race Conditions: Prevent overselling of tickets due to concurrent reservations.
4. Geographically Distributed Load: Efficiently serve users from various Asian countries.
5. Queueing Mechanism: Implement a fair and transparent queueing system.
6. Payment Gateway Integration: Ensure the payment system can handle the transaction volume.
7. Bot Prevention: Implement CAPTCHA or other mechanisms to prevent automated ticket purchasing.
8. User Communication: Provide real-time updates to users about their queue position and ticket availability.

## Discussion Points for the Workshop:

1. What architecture would be most suitable for this high-concurrency scenario?
2. How to implement a fair queueing system that can handle 100,000+ concurrent users?
3. What database technology and caching strategies would be most appropriate?
4. How to ensure real-time inventory updates across a distributed system?
5. What strategies can be employed to prevent ticket scalping and fraud?
6. How to design the system to be resilient to partial failures?
7. What kind of monitoring and alerting system should be in place?
8. How to handle the potential for regional network issues or failures?
9. What strategies can be used to manage user expectations and provide a positive experience even if they don't secure tickets?
