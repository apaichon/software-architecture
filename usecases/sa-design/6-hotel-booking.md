# Title: Hotel Booking System
## Background:
A hotel booking system that allows guests to book rooms online or through a hotel's front desk. Online bookings are immediately confirmed upon submission. Front desk bookings are processed in real-time, ensuring room availability and accurate guest information. All bookings are displayed in real-time at the hotel's management system.

## Key Points:

1. Two Booking Methods: Online and at the front desk
2. Real-time Online Booking Confirmation
3. Time-Bound Front Desk Booking: Ensures real-time room availability
4. Real-time Booking Display at the hotel's management system

## Use Case Description:
Design a secure, scalable, and user-friendly system for managing hotel bookings, handling both online and front desk bookings, ensuring accurate room allocation and real-time booking management and display.

## Requirements:

1. Dual Booking Methods: Support both online booking and traditional front desk booking.
2. Real-time Processing: Immediately confirm and process online bookings.
3. Secure Authentication: Implement robust guest authentication for both online and in-person bookings.
4. Real-time Room Allocation: Ensure accurate room allocation and availability for front desk bookings.
5. Time-Bound Operations: Enforce real-time processing for front desk bookings.
6. Booking Aggregation: Continuously aggregate bookings from online and front desk.
7. Real-time Display: Show up-to-date booking information at the hotel's management system.
8. Audit Trail: Maintain a secure, verifiable audit trail for all bookings.
9. Scalability: Handle potentially thousands of bookings across both booking methods.
10. Accessibility: Ensure the system is accessible to guests with disabilities.
11. Booking Verification: Allow for independent verification of bookings.
12. Reporting: Generate comprehensive reports for hotel management and guest services.

## Challenges to Address:

1. Security: Protect against booking fraud, system hacking, and data manipulation.
2. Guest Privacy: Ensure guest anonymity while maintaining booking verifiability.
3. System Reliability: Maintain high availability and fault tolerance, especially for online booking.
4. Data Consistency: Ensure accurate and consistent data across all system components.
5. Peak Load Management: Handle potential surge in online bookings, especially during peak travel seasons.
6. Offline Capabilities: Enable front desk to function if internet connectivity is lost.
7. Booking Integrity: Prevent premature booking disclosure and ensure accuracy of real-time updates.
8. Accessibility: Cater to diverse guest needs, including multiple languages and accessibility features.
9. Transparency: Provide mechanisms for hotel management oversight without compromising security.
10. Regulatory Compliance: Adhere to hotel industry laws and regulations.
