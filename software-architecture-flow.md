## 4. Data Flow

### 4.1 User Registration Flow
1. User submits registration details via Web/Mobile application
2. Frontend validates input and sends request to API Gateway
3. API Gateway routes request to User Service
4. User Service validates data and creates user record in database
5. User Service publishes UserCreated event to Message Queue
6. Notification Service consumes event and sends welcome email
7. Response is returned through API Gateway to Frontend
8. Frontend updates UI to show successful registration

### 4.2 Order Processing Flow
1. User adds products to cart and proceeds to checkout
2. Frontend sends order creation request to API Gateway
3. API Gateway routes request to Order Service
4. Order Service:
   - Validates order details
   - Reserves inventory via Product Service
   - Creates order record in database
   - Initiates payment via Payment Service
5. Payment Service processes payment via external Payment Gateway
6. Upon successful payment:
   - Payment Service updates payment status
   - Order Service updates order status
   - Order Service publishes OrderCreated event
7. Notification Service sends order confirmation
8. Product Service updates inventory
9. Response flows back to user interface
