# Publisher-Subscriber Pattern in Rust

## Overview
The Publisher-Subscriber (Pub/Sub) pattern is a messaging pattern where senders of messages (publishers) don't send messages directly to specific receivers (subscribers). Instead, messages are published to topics/channels, and subscribers receive messages from topics they're interested in.

## Implementation Details

### Key Components
1. **Publisher**: Publishes messages to specific topics
2. **Subscriber**: Receives messages from subscribed topics
3. **Message Broker**: Manages subscriptions and message delivery
4. **Message**: Contains the topic and content being transmitted

### Features
- Thread-safe implementation using `Arc` and `Mutex`
- Type-safe message handling
- Support for multiple subscribers per topic
- Extensible subscriber implementation

## Running the Example

1. Make sure you have Rust installed
2. Navigate to this directory
3. Run the example:
```bash
rustc pub_sub_example.rs
./pub_sub_example
```

## Use Cases
- Event-driven architectures
- Distributed systems
- Real-time notifications
- System monitoring
- Data streaming applications

## Benefits
1. **Loose Coupling**: Publishers and subscribers don't need to know about each other
2. **Scalability**: Easy to add new subscribers without affecting publishers
3. **Flexibility**: Each subscriber can process messages differently
4. **Maintainability**: Components can be modified independently

## Considerations
- Message ordering
- Error handling
- Dead letter queues
- Message persistence
- Scaling considerations

## Extended Features (Possible Additions)
- Async message processing
- Message filtering
- Quality of Service (QoS) levels
- Message acknowledgment
- Message replay capability
