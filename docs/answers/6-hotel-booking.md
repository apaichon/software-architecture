# Title: Hotel Booking System
## Background:
A hotel booking system that allows guests to book rooms online or through a hotel's front desk. Online bookings are immediately confirmed upon submission. Front desk bookings are processed in real-time, ensuring room availability and accurate guest information. All bookings are displayed in real-time at the hotel's management system.

## Key Points:

1. Two Booking Methods: Online and at the front desk
2. Real-time Online Booking Confirmation
3. Time-Bound Front Desk Booking: Ensures real-time room availability
4. Real-time Booking Display at the hotel's management system

## Use Case Description:
Design a secure, scalable, and user-friendly system for managing hotel bookings, handling both online and front desk bookings, ensuring accurate room allocation and real-time booking management and display.

## Requirements:

1. Dual Booking Methods: Support both online booking and traditional front desk booking.
2. Real-time Processing: Immediately confirm and process online bookings.
3. Secure Authentication: Implement robust guest authentication for both online and in-person bookings.
4. Real-time Room Allocation: Ensure accurate room allocation and availability for front desk bookings.
5. Time-Bound Operations: Enforce real-time processing for front desk bookings.
6. Booking Aggregation: Continuously aggregate bookings from online and front desk.
7. Real-time Display: Show up-to-date booking information at the hotel's management system.
8. Audit Trail: Maintain a secure, verifiable audit trail for all bookings.
9. Scalability: Handle potentially thousands of bookings across both booking methods.
10. Accessibility: Ensure the system is accessible to guests with disabilities.
11. Booking Verification: Allow for independent verification of bookings.
12. Reporting: Generate comprehensive reports for hotel management and guest services.

## Challenges to Address:

1. Security: Protect against booking fraud, system hacking, and data manipulation.
2. Guest Privacy: Ensure guest anonymity while maintaining booking verifiability.
3. System Reliability: Maintain high availability and fault tolerance, especially for online booking.
4. Data Consistency: Ensure accurate and consistent data across all system components.
5. Peak Load Management: Handle potential surge in online bookings, especially during peak travel seasons.
6. Offline Capabilities: Enable front desk to function if internet connectivity is lost.
7. Booking Integrity: Prevent premature booking disclosure and ensure accuracy of real-time updates.
8. Accessibility: Cater to diverse guest needs, including multiple languages and accessibility features.
9. Transparency: Provide mechanisms for hotel management oversight without compromising security.
10. Regulatory Compliance: Adhere to hotel industry laws and regulations.

## Discussion Points for the Workshop:

1. What architecture would be most suitable for this dual-method, high-stakes hotel booking system?
2. How to implement a secure online booking system that ensures both anonymity and verifiability?
3. What strategies can be employed to prevent double booking across online and front desk methods?
4. How to design the room allocation system for front desk bookings to ensure accuracy and speed?
5. What database technology and replication strategies would be most appropriate for handling distributed booking data with real-time aggregation?
6. How to implement a robust audit system that allows for booking verification without compromising guest privacy?
7. What kind of encryption and security measures should be in place to protect guest data and prevent booking tampering?
8. How to design the system to be resilient to various types of attacks, including DDoS attacks on the online booking platform?
9. What strategies can be used to ensure the system remains operational even if some front desks lose internet connectivity?
10. How to implement a real-time booking display system that is both accurate and resistant to premature booking leaks?
11. What kind of failsafes and redundancies should be built into the system to prevent data loss or system failure?
12. How to design the system to accommodate future booking method additions or changes in hotel industry laws?
