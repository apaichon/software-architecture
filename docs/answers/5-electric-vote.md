# Title: Mixed Online and Polling Station Election System
## Background:
An election system that allows both online voting and traditional voting at polling stations. Online votes are recorded immediately upon submission. Polling station votes are counted from 17:00 until the following morning. Results are submitted as soon as counting is completed at each polling station, using a QR code scanning system for verification. All results are displayed in real-time at a central location.

## Key Points:

1. Two Voting Methods: Online and at polling stations
2. Real-time Online Vote Recording
3. Time-Bound Polling Station Count: Starts at 17:00
4. QR Code Verification for Paper Ballots
Immediate Central Result Display

## Use Case Description:
Design a secure, scalable, and transparent system for managing a mixed-method election, handling both online and paper ballot voting, ensuring accurate vote counting and real-time result aggregation and display.

## Requirements:

1. Dual Voting Methods: Support both online voting and traditional paper ballot voting.
2. Real-time Processing: Immediately record and aggregate online votes.
3. Secure Authentication: Implement robust voter authentication for both online and in-person voting.
4. QR Code Verification: Integrate QR code scanning for paper ballot verification and counting.
5. Time-Bound Operations: Enforce start time (17:00) for polling station vote counting.
6. Result Aggregation: Continuously aggregate results from online votes and polling stations.
7. Real-time Display: Show up-to-date election results at a central location.
8. Audit Trail: Maintain a secure, verifiable audit trail for all votes.
9. Scalability: Handle potentially millions of voters across both voting methods.
10. Accessibility: Ensure the system is accessible to voters with disabilities.
11. Result Verification: Allow for independent verification of vote counts.
12. Reporting: Generate comprehensive reports for election officials and public transparency.

## Challenges to Address:

1. Security: Protect against voter fraud, system hacking, and data manipulation.
2. Voter Privacy: Ensure voter anonymity while maintaining vote verifiability.
3. System Reliability: Maintain high availability and fault tolerance, especially for online voting.
4. Data Consistency: Ensure accurate and consistent data across all system components.
5. Peak Load Management: Handle potential surge in online voting, especially close to the deadline.
6. Offline Capabilities: Enable polling stations to function if internet connectivity is lost.
7. Result Integrity: Prevent premature result disclosure and ensure accuracy of real-time updates.
8. Accessibility: Cater to diverse voter needs, including multiple languages and accessibility features.
9. Transparency: Provide mechanisms for public oversight without compromising security.
10. Regulatory Compliance: Adhere to election laws and regulations.

## Discussion Points for the Workshop:

1. What architecture would be most suitable for this dual-method, high-stakes voting system?
2. How to implement a secure online voting system that ensures both anonymity and verifiability?
3. What strategies can be employed to prevent double voting across online and paper ballot methods?
4. How to design the QR code system for paper ballots to ensure accuracy and speed in vote counting?
5. What database technology and replication strategies would be most appropriate for handling distributed voting data with real-time aggregation?
6. How to implement a robust audit system that allows for vote verification without compromising voter privacy?
7. What kind of encryption and security measures should be in place to protect voter data and prevent result tampering?
8. How to design the system to be resilient to various types of attacks, including DDoS attacks on the online voting platform?
9. What strategies can be used to ensure the system remains operational even if some polling stations lose internet connectivity?
10. How to implement a real-time result display system that is both accurate and resistant to premature result leaks?
11. What kind of failsafes and redundancies should be built into the system to prevent data loss or system failure?
12. How to design the system to accommodate future voting method additions or changes in election laws?
